# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Bug fixes

* Fix lack of commas in diffs (?).

### Improvements

* Change how objects are inspected on a single line so that instance variables
  are always sorted.
* Make a tweak to how hashes are presented in diffs and inspections: a hash that
  has a mixture of symbols and strings will be presented as though all keys are
  strings (i.e. hashrocket syntax).

## 0.5.0 - 2020-06-18

### Breaking changes

* Do some reorganizing and rename some concepts in the code: "operational
  sequencer" changes to "operation tree builder" and "operation sequence"
  changes to "operation tree". Although super_diff is not yet at 1.0, this does
  result in breaking changes to the API, so:

  * If you are inheriting from `SuperDiff::OperationalSequencers::*`, you will
    want to now inherit from `SuperDiff::OperationTreeBuilders::*`.
  * If you are inheriting from `SuperDiff::OperationSequence::*`, you will
    want to now inherit from `SuperDiff::OperationTrees::*`.
  * If you are configuring the gem by saying:

    ``` ruby
    SuperDiff::RSpec.configuration do |config|
      config.add_extra_operational_sequencer_class(SomeClass)
      config.add_extra_operation_sequence_class(SomeClass)
    end
    ```

    you will want to change this to:

    ``` ruby
    SuperDiff::RSpec.configuration do |config|
      config.add_extra_operation_tree_builder_class(SomeClass)
      config.add_extra_operation_tree_class(SomeClass)
    end
    ```

### Bug fixes

* Get rid of warnings produced on Ruby 2.7.1. ([#71])
* Fix diff produced by (incorrect) usage of `have_attributes` with a hash as the
  actual value. ([#76])

### Improvements

* Move configuration so that instead of using

  ``` ruby
  SuperDiff::RSpec.configure do |config|
    # ...
  end
  ```

  you can now say:

  ``` ruby
  SuperDiff.configure do |config|
    # ...
  end
  ```

  ([#80])

* Update diff between two hashes so that original ordering of keys is preserved.

## 0.2.0 - 2019-10-04

Lots of fixes and new features!

### Features

* Fix how objects are displayed in diff output:
  * Fix output of diffs so that objects are deeply pretty printed.
  * Use Object#inspect as a fallback for single-line object inspection.
* Support diffing ordinary, "non-custom" objects (those that do *not* respond to
  `attributes_for_super_diff`).
* Add custom coloring/messaging to `include` matcher.
* Support pretty-printing `a_hash_including` objects and diffing them with
  hashes.
* Support pretty-printing `a_collection_including` objects and diffing them with
  arrays.
* Add custom coloring/messaging to `have_attributes` matcher.
* Support pretty-printing `an_object_having_attributes` objects and diffing them
  with other objects.
* Add a key/legend to the diff output so it's less confusing.
* Add custom coloring/messaging to `respond_to` matcher.
* Add custom coloring/messaging to `raise_error` matcher.
* Fix output from diff between a multi-line string with a single-line (and vice
  versa).
* Make sure that RSpec double objects are pretty-printed correctly Add custom
  coloring/messaging to `contain_exactly`.
* Support pretty-printing `a_collection_containing_exactly` objects and diffing
  them with other arrays.
* Add support for diffing ActiveRecord models.
* Add support for diffing ActiveRecord::Relation objects with arrays.
* Fix output for diff between two completely different kinds of objects
* Support pretty-printing HashWithIndifferentAccess objects and diffing them
  with hashes.
* Detect and handle recursive data structures.
* Automatically disable color output when running tests non-interactively (e.g.
  on a CI service).
* Add custom coloring/messaging to `be_*` matcher.
* Fix representation of empty arrays, hashes, and objects in diffs so that they
  are always on single lines.
* Change colors in diffs and messages from red/green to magenta/yellow.
* Use bold to highlight "Failure/Error" instead of white so that output looks
  good on a light terminal color scheme
* Fix coloring for unhandled errors so that the whole message isn't colored in
  red, but only the first line.

## 0.1.0 - 2019-10-02

Initial version!

### Features

* Support diffing primitives.
* Support diffing strings (single-line and multi-line).
* Support diffing arrays (simple and complex).
* Support diffing "custom objects" (i.e. objects that respond to
  `attributes_for_super_diff`).
* Add basic integration with RSpec.
